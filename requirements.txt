# Main dependencies for Face Attendance System
opencv-python
face-recognition
numpy
Pillow
PySide6
# Optional: Needed to build dlib from source (face-recognition dependency)
cmake  # Only needed if dlib wheel is not available

# Note:
# - Python 3.8â€“3.11 recommended for best compatibility with face-recognition and dlib.
# - On Windows, you may need to install CMake and Visual Studio Build Tools if using Python 3.12+ or if a dlib wheel is not available.
